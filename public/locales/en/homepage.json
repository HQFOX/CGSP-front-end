	"howItStartedTitle": "How It All Began",
	"howItStartedTextP1": "The origins of the Giraldo Sem Pavor Cooperative for Affordable Housing and Construction, CRL date back to February 26, 1976, when the São Sebastião Residents' Association was founded. This association emerged from the merger of two neighboring entities dedicated to improving the living conditions of local residents: the Sanches Miranda Neighborhood Residents' Association and the Bairro do Gancho Residents' Association.",
	"howItStartedTextP2": "The early years were marked by significant challenges. With limited resources but great ambition, the association had to overcome numerous obstacles to achieve its goals. Thanks to the collective effort and commitment of all involved, the necessary funding was secured to begin construction of the first housing units.",
	"howItStartedTextP3": "The process, however, was far from easy. Delays in funding caused several interruptions in the works, extending their completion until 1983/1984, when the first houses were finally finished. The project received financial support from the former Housing Development Fund (Fundo de Fomento da Habitação).",
	"howItStartedTextP4": "Over time, and as a natural evolution of the organization, the São Sebastião Residents' Association was dissolved, giving rise to the current Giraldo Sem Pavor Cooperative, officially established on November 29, 1982.",
	"howItStartedTextP5": "Following its establishment, the Cooperative also began the restoration of the old Alentejo farmhouse, which became its Social Headquarters—a symbol of the organization's journey, resilience, and collective identity that continue to inspire its mission to this day.",
	"howItStartedTextP6": "Despite all this, we believe that our work speaks for itself, and therefore we invite you to explore our History section, where you can find our completed projects."
